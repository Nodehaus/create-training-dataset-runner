# Our runner to create training and evaluation datasets

This repository contains a script to create datasets from job files on S3. It also contains a Dockerfile to create a
Ollama severless instance on Runpod to generate the dataset examples via a self-hosted LLM. As alternative you can also
use the OpenAI API with an API key.
